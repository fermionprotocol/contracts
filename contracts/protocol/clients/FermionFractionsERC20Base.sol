 * - _transfer renamed to _transferFractions
 * - _approve renamed to _approveFractions
 * - _transferFrom renamed to _transferFractionsFrom
 * - _mint renamed to _mintFractions
 * - public methods `transferFrom` and `approve` are not defined in this contract. They are defined as part of
 *   the FermionFNFT overrides, where ERC721 and ERC20 are combined. This is done, since otherwise the ERC20 and ERC721
